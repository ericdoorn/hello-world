# hello-world
my first steps on Github
Long long ago in the galayxy I programmed a lot in the good old C and Pascal programming language. You could even consider me as a master on it. as time goes by, I evoluate to a business architect, and did not bother anymore on the actual programming. I noticed that my valuable experience can become more effective when I get more feeling about the current way of programming, their techniques, their strengths and limitations.
